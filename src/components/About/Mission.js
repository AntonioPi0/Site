          <p>
          We are a team of university students dedicated to developing advanced solutions in the field of 
          Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) vehicles. Our work focuses on building prototypes for Urban 
          Air Mobility, a rapidly evolving sector that promises to revolutionize transportation in our cities 
          by improving efficiency and reducing congestion in urban infrastructures. Our team comprises students 
          from various engineering disciplines, with a significant number specializing in aerospace engineering. 
          Together, we work towards a common goal: tackling the technical and design challenges of Advanced Air 
          Mobility, contributing to shaping a future where drones and other VTOL vehicles can integrate safely 
          and efficiently into urban environments. We participate in international competitions, where we test 
          our ideas and skills in highly competitive settings. These events enable us to refine our expertise, 
          collaborate with industry experts, and push the boundaries of technological innovation. 
          </p>

          <p> With a focus on sustainability, emissions reduction, and seamless 
            integration with existing urban infrastructures, we aim to set the standards for future air mobility. 
            Convinced that Advanced Air Mobility will be a driving force for change, we are ready to embark on this 
            exciting journey toward the future of mobility and engineering.
