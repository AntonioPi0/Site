          <p>
          We are a <b>team of university students</b> dedicated to developing advanced solutions in the <b>field of 
          Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) vehicles</b> Our work focuses on building prototypes for Urban 
          Air Mobility, a rapidly evolving sector that promises to revolutionize transportation in our cities 
          by improving efficiency and reducing congestion in urban infrastructures. Our team comprises <b>students 
          from various engineering disciplines</b>, with a significant number specializing in aerospace engineering. 
          Together, we work towards a common goal: tackling the technical and design challenges of Advanced Air 
          Mobility, contributing to shaping a future where drones and other VTOL vehicles can integrate safely 
          and efficiently into urban environments. We participate in <b>international competitions</b>, where we test 
          our ideas and skills in highly competitive settings. These events enable us to refine our expertise, 
          collaborate with industry experts, and push the boundaries of technological innovation. 
          </p>

          <p> With a <b>focus on sustainability</b>, emissions reduction, and seamless 
            integration with existing urban infrastructures, we aim to <b>set the standards for future air mobility</b>. 
            Convinced that Advanced Air Mobility will be a driving force for change, we are ready to embark on this 
            exciting journey toward the future of mobility and engineering.
